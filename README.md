  <i>Scripts, Dotfiles and Binaries for setting up Fedora after installation</i>
</p>

# about
Setting up Fedora after installation takes too much time. 
In this repository I try to solve some overhead by automating:
- Installing workstation reposotories
- Installing essential packages via [DNF](https://github.com/thevenus/fedora-setup-private/blob/master/PackageLists/dnfs) and [Flatpak](https://github.com/thevenus/fedora-setup-private/blob/master/PackageLists/flatpaks)
- Link configuration files to their appropriate places

1. Install workstation repositories (google, rpmfusion, atom)
2. Install Dropbox and Teamviewer via rpm download
3. Install packages via [DNF](https://github.com/thevenus/fedora-setup-private/blob/master/PackageLists/dnfs) and [Flatpak](https://github.com/thevenus/fedora-setup-private/blob/master/PackageLists/flatpaks) 
4. Edit bashrc to make a smarter terminal
5. Disable Wayland and use Xorg for Graphics
